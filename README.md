# Chargify SDK CLI

A simple CLI for the [Go Chargify SDK](https://github.com/GetWagz/go-chargify/). This CLI was created as part of a large PR from @ghstahl (thanks!) but we don't want to ship it with the library, so we broke it out into a different repo.

This is an initial version of the CLI. It was tested locally, but automated tests are still needed. Use at your own risk.
